Subject: [PATCH 04/17] gtkwaylandsink: Force a redraw on resolution change

As we don't render into the widget directly, there is no "initial" draw
happening. As a side effect, the internal aspect ratio adapted display
width/height is never initialize leading to assertions when handling navigation
events.

  gst_video_center_rect: assertion 'src->h != 0' failed

Simply queue a redraw after setting the widget format in order to fix the issue.
